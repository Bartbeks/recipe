<!-- #INSTRUCTIONS

Peel and finely dice the onion, garlic and ginger. Drain the tins of chickpeas, slice the red pepper and remove the insides.
Heat a wide bottomed non-stick pan on high heat and once hot reduce to medium hot.
Add in the diced onion and ginger and fry to 2-3 mins until it starts to brown. If it starts to catch, add a couple of tablespoons of water and 'deglaze' the pan.
Add the cumin seeds, garlic, red pepper and a teaspoon of salt and fry for a further 2 mins until the peppers start to cook down a little.
Add the spices, the turmeric, garam masala, cinnamon, black pepper and cook for another 1 minute.
Add the veg stock, tamari and chopped tomatoes and bring to a boil, add the baby spinach and mix well.
Sieve in the gram flour and mix through.
Finely slice the chilli and serve on top.
Serve with toasted pitta breads or your favourite grains. -->
